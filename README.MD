## About The Project
### About Me 
Hello World I' am a self taught programmer situated on an Island in Malaysia where their aren't many programers I can reach out too. I have been teaching myself how to program through Codecademy and from following the Course. I have now landed on the Task of doing a "Mixed-Message" generator. Though the task may sound simple I would like to amp it up by incorporating HTML and CSS as well as incorporate some of things I have learnt about using Git and Github. Thus here I am asking the world if there is anybody who would rescue a poor soul stranded. ;D

### Project
I have provided an image of an already on hand "To-Do list" that I would like to imitate **below** part of this file. I figured why not try to imitate something that already exist on hand through ***learn by imitation***.

***Sample document to replicate.***

Ultimately there are three parts I would like this program to do for now. More complexity would be added added later down the line.

#### First 

* Getting user inputs for each section of the list and pushing it to an array identified by the section. 

#### Second 

* Have a button that would generate a report to display on another page.


#### Third 

* Have it randomly suggest which task to choose to do.
